              ArtWorks is a place where artists and their fans are empowered to change the world! We do this by holding quarterly competitions between submitted creations from artists who want to make a difference with their work. Our winning designs will be produced and sold as t-shirts with all profits going towards our selected charity. Check out this quarter's charity below!
